/**
 * Scaling scan: times each input shape at three sizes against one revision.
 *
 *   node perf/scan.mts [rev=WORKTREE] [--factor 4] [--reps 5] [--min-ms 20]
 *
 * Linear work costs about `factor` times more at `factor` times the input. A ratio well above that
 * marks a superlinear path, which the A/B suite cannot see: on the input sizes a benchmark uses, a
 * quadratic resolver is invisible, and on long input it costs five to seventeen times. Profile
 * every shape the scan flags and look for mid-array `splice`, `shift`, `unshift` or `indexOf`
 * inside a loop over the same array.
 *
 * Two rules keep the flags honest, both learned from a scan that cried wolf. Each shape's base size
 * grows until its body takes at least `--min-ms`, because a 5 ms base makes noise look like
 * curvature. And the scan measures n, 4n and 16n, flagging only when **both** steps exceed the
 * factor: one bad step is noise, two in a row is a shape.
 *
 * Size is not only input length. The second shape to try is **N operations against one long-lived
 * object**: a listener list, a cache, a registry, a header collection that a pipeline appends to.
 * Those grow with the life of an object rather than with the size of an input, so no input-length
 * shape reaches them, and a duplicate check that walks the list turns a loop into O(n²). One
 * campaign found exactly that, with step ratios of 17x and 24x.
 *
 * The cases module exports `buildScan(lib)`: shapes that take a size and return an input.
