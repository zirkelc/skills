/**
 * Characterisation guard: hashes the observable behaviour of every case and compares it with the
 * recorded expectations.
 *
 *   node --import tsx perf/guard.mts             check the working tree, exit 1 on any difference
 *   node --import tsx perf/guard.mts --update    record expectations (once, before the first experiment)
 *   node --import tsx perf/guard.mts main --update    add the cases you added, recorded against the base
 *
 * Once the expectation file exists, `--update` can only **add** keys. An existing key whose hash
 * changed makes it fail, whichever revision it was computed from. That is the rule "never update the
 * guard to make a change pass", enforced rather than remembered; re-recording everything means
 * deleting the file, which is a visible act.
 *
 * The third form is the campaign rule for a case added mid-campaign: its expectation has to come
 * from the base revision, not from the working tree that the new case was written against. Run it
 * without `--only`, even though only one case is new. Recomputing the others against the base costs
 * one pass and is the check that nobody moved an existing case while adding the new one, which is
 * the way a guard quietly stops guarding.
